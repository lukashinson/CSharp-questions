# CSharp-questions
1.) What is a namespace? A namespace is used to organize code.
---
2.) What are value types? Value types are different types that hold values. Ex. int = 22
---
3.) What are reference types? Reference types hold the memory address instead of the actual values
---
4.) What is an automatic property and how is it useful? Automatic property automatically sets values. It is important because it saves time.
---
5.) What is the purpose of using statement? It is used to implement the IDisposable interface
---
6.)What are the dynamic type variables? Variables that you can store to check the run time.
---
7.) What is the purpose of the is operator? It is used to check compatibility with an object.
---
8.)What are generics and how is using them useful? Allows methods to be parameters. Using them will improve the performance of the application.
---
9.)What is the scope of a public member of a class?
---
10.) Can you create a function that can accept a varying number of arguments? Yes they are called params.
---
11.)How do you sort an array?
int[] values = { 99, 720, 2, 126 };
        Array.Sort(values);
        foreach (int value in values)
        {
            Console.Write(value);
            Console.Write(' ');
        }
        Console.WriteLine();
    }
}
---
12.) What is a nullable type and what purpose does it serve? Allows values to be set to a special value.
---
13.) What is an enumeration? Enumeration is a set of named integer constants.
---
14.) What is inheritance? Ability to create a class that inherits attributes and behaviors from an another class.
---
15.)Is multiple inheritance supported? C# does not support multiple inheritance.
---
16.)What is the purpose of as operator? It performs conversions between compatible types
---
17.) What is an object? A class that is created by user blueprints
---
18.) What is the difference between a struct and a class? Classes are reference types and Structs are value types.
---
19.) What is the difference between continue and break statements? The break statement causes the innermost loop to exit and the continue statement allows you to skip one or multiple statements.
---
20.) What is this and how is it used? This is the current instance of your class. It is used as a modifier.
---
21.)What is try and catch and when are they used? The try block identifies a block of code for which exceptions are activated. The catch block catches an exception at the place were you want to handle the exception.
---
22.)How is exception handling done? Implemented using try, catch, and other keywords.
---
23.)What is finally and what is its purpose? Finally is the block that executes a given set of statements whether an exception is thrown or not thrown.
---
24.) List the differences between Array and ArrayList.
* Array list can store any type of data
* Array can only store specific type of items or elements.
---
25.)What is an object? A class that is created by user blueprints
---
26.) Define constructor. Is a class that gets automatically invoked whenever a class is created in an instance.
---
27.)When can var be used to declare a variable and how is the type for the variable determined? It is used in the beginning when you are setting all your variables and it is determined by what yo set it too.
---
28.)What is an abstract class? A class that can't be instantiated. Designed to be inherited by subclasses.
---
29.)What is an interface? This contains the declaration of methods, events, and properties.
---
30.)What is a method? A code block that contains a series of statements.
---
31.)What is a property? A tool that reads and writes the value of a private field.
---
32.)What is an access specifier? Describe as the scope of accessibility of an object.
---
33.) What access specifiers are supported and what do they mean? Public, private, protected, protected internal, and internal
---
34.)What is a collection? The job of the collection class are allocating memory dynamically to elements and accessing a list of terms in the index.
---
35.)What is a Hash Table? Represents a collection of key and value pairs that are organized based on the hash code of key.
